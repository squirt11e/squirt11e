# Hello friend! 👋

I'm Squirtle0x, a frontend developer and crypto enthusiast since 2020.

My first exposure to crypto was actually in 2010 when I mined my first bitcoin just for fun! Those sats are lost somewhere in a digital limbo, who would have thought that the concept of self-sovereign digital assets would become such a big thing?!

I believe in viewing life with optimism - my glass is always half full.
